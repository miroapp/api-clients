### Using Miro authentication wrapper

Miro class is a wrapper that handles authorization and per-user access token management.

To start using the client create a new instance:

```typescript
import {Miro} from '@mirohq/miro-node'

const miro = new Miro()
```

By default client will load the app configuration from environment variables: `MIRO_CLIENT_ID`, `MIRO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MIRO_REDIRECT_URL`. They can also be provided by passing the options object to the iconstructor.

```typescript
const miro = new Miro({
  clientId: 'your_app_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_app_secret',
  redirectUrl: 'https://foo.bar/miro_return_url',
})
```

Other options are documented in the [reference](https://miroapp.github.io/api-clients/interfaces/index.Opts.html).

The client has all methods that are needed to complete Miro authorization flows and make API calls:

1. Check if current user has authorized the app: `miro.isAuthorized('some_user_id')`
2. Request user to authorize the app by redirecting them to: `miro.getAuthUrl()`
3. Exchange users authorization code for a token in the return url's request handler: `await miro.exchangeCodeForAccessToken('some_user_id', 'https://foo.bar/miro_return_url?code=12345')`
4. Use the API as a specific user: `await miro.as('some_user_id').getBoards()`

Most methods (`isAuthorized`, `exchangeCodeForAccessToken`, `api`) take `user_id` as a first paramters. This is the ID of the user in your app. The one that is currently logged in. It can be either a string or a number.

In order to persist user's access and refresh tokens client library requires a persistent storage. By default it uses filesystem to store this state. For production deployments we recommend using a custom implementation backed by a database. It can be passed as an option to Miro contructor:

```typescript
const miro = new Miro({
  storage: new CustomMiroStorage(),
})
```

Storage should implement the following interface:

```typescript
export interface Storage {
  read(userId: ExternalUserId): Promise<State | undefined>
  write(userId: ExternalUserId, state: State): Awaitable<void>
}
```

The client will automatically refresh access tokens if it is going to expire soon.

See [the example usage](../../apps/fastify/fastify.js) with _fastify_ web framework.

### Methods & Models

`.as(userId: string)` method returns the instance of the [Api](https://miroapp.github.io/api-clients/classes/highlevel.Api.html) class. This instance provides methods to create and get the list of `Board` models which then provides methods to get `Item` model and so forth.

Client provides a few helper methods that make it easy to paginate over all resources. For example [getAllBoards](https://miroapp.github.io/api-clients/classes/highlevel.Api.html#getAllBoards) method returns an async iterator that can be used to iterate over all available boards:

```typescript
for await (const board of api.getAllBoards()) {
  console.log(board.viewLink)
}
```

### Using stateless MiroApi directly

Besides the high level stateful Miro client the library also exposes a stateless low level client:

```typescript
import {MiroApi} from './index.ts'

const api = new MiroApi('ACCESS_TOKEN')

const boards = await api.getBoards()
```

See the [documentation](https://miroapp.github.io/api-clients/interfaces/api.MiroApi.html) for a full list of methods.
