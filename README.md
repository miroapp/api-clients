## Miro API clients

This repository contains Miro API clients and the tools needed to generate them, based on the OpenAPI specification (OAS).
Currently, the only available client is the [Node.js client](./packages/miro-api), written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Miro Postman Collection

- This repo also contains `postman` workspace that uses `spec.json` created with `update-spec.ts` to generate the postman collection. 

If you have updated any yaml files, generate a new `spec.json` by running :

`yarn update-spec`

To generate the collection locally from `spec.json`, go to the root directory (api-clients), and run : 

`yarn postman:publish`

The generated collection is available at `generated/postman-collection.json` for reference.
